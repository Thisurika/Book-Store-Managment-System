# 📚 Little Book Heaven – Bookstore Management System

**Little Book Heaven** is a Java EE-based web application designed to manage a bookstore system with role-based access. Developed as part of my undergraduate studies at SLIIT, this project demonstrates strong use of Object-Oriented Programming, File Handling, and Data Structures (Merge Sort and Binary Search Tree).
